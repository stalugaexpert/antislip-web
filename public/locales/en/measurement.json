  "readMore": "Read more on our blog.",
  "measurementWhy": "Why is it necessary to check the condition of flooring for slip resistance?",
  "measurementWhyDescription": "Every ceramic tile, over time and with the intensity of use, loses its factory slip resistance. Therefore, the slip resistance of floors should be checked periodically (at least once every 3 years), as part of technical inspections of facilities.",

  "measurementWhoDescription": "Designers, building inspectors, investors, managers, administrators of public facilities or residential buildings, wanting to ensure that their floors are safe and in compliance with applicable laws, guidelines and guides, regularly test the slip resistance, of new and in-service floors.",

    "first": {
      "question": "When does a surface become slippery?",
      "paragraphFirst": "Any surface, over time and with the intensity of use, loses its factory slip resistance and becomes dangerous."
    },
    "second": {
      "question": "What does the slipperiness of a floor depend on?",
      "paragraphFirst": "The slip resistance of a given floor under actual conditions depends on, among other things:",
      "paragraphSecond": "- the type of flooring, e.g. glazed porcelain stoneware, polished granite, marble, resin, PVC,",
      "paragraphThird": "- type of sole e.g. PU, TR, EVA, styrogum, tuniscus, natural leather,",
      "paragraphFourth": "- type of lube e.g. water, mud, juices, oil, ketchup, mustard, soups, sauces,",
      "paragraphFifth": "- pressure force i.e. our weight."
    },
    "third": {
      "question": "What does the method of measuring slip resistance depend on?",
      "paragraphFirst": "Depending on where the floor is located, how it is used, or the occupational or age characteristics of the people using it, each floor requires a professional, individual approach before measurement and service."
    },
    "fourth": {
      "question": "Is a wet floor more dangerous?",
      "paragraphFirst": "The slip resistance coefficient of wet and dry flooring is different - so care should be taken to ensure the safety of people walking on it, especially when it is wet."
    },
    "fifth": {
      "question": "Is the anti-slip class of all ceramic tiles the same?",
      "paragraphFirst": "Ceramic tiles can vary significantly in their R or A/B/C slip resistance class, PTV or dynamic coefficient of friction Âµ values."
